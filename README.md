##1. Overview
An ice cream shop in Hawaii wants to understand the historical weather patterns in their area to better predict sales. Queries were sent through a sqlite database for the months of June and December to compare the temperatures of both months. 
##2. Results
-As expected June showed slightly higher temperatures compared to December. 
-The average temperatures during June was 75 degrees F and in december the average was 71 degrees F. 
-The range of temperatures were very similar as well as the standard deviation indicating that the fluctuation in temperatures are simliar for both months.
##3. Summary
Based off of the statistics June and December seem to have similar temperature ranges. Although December has slightly lower temperatures this may not cause drops in sales due to the differences being less than 10 degrees F. Other information is required to be able to understand purchasing behavior for ice cream. Another query to look at would be precipatation amount. This could indicate whether rain and humidity have any effect on ice cream demand. Another possible query would be to expand the dates examined. Year on year or monthly comparisons of temperatures would be useful to target hotest months to see if sales increased as a result
